Core library
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some objects and actions could be used in several application deployments.
All common parts are grouped into MuranoPL libraries.
Murano core library is a set of classes needed in every deployment as helpers for application classes.
This library is located under the `meta <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/murano/tree/meta/io.murano/>`_ directory.
